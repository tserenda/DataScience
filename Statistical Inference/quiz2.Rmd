##Question 1

What is the variance of the distribution of the average an IID draw of n observations from a population with mean ?? and variance ??2. 

##A1

Var(X¯)=??2/n

##Question 2

Suppose that diastolic blood pressures (DBPs) for men aged 35-44 are normally distributed with a mean of 80 (mm Hg) and a standard deviation of 10. About what is the probability that a random 35-44 year old has a DBP less than 70?

##A2

```{r}
pnorm(70, mean = 80, sd = 10)
```

##Question 3

Brain volume for adult women is normally distributed with a mean of about 1,100 cc for women with a standard deviation of 75 cc. What brain volume represents the 95th percentile?

##A3

```{r}
qnorm(0.95, mean = 1100, sd = 75)
```

##Question 4

Refer to the previous question. Brain volume for adult women is about 1,100 cc for women with a standard deviation of 75 cc. Consider the sample mean of 100 random adult women from this population. What is the 95th percentile of the distribution of that sample mean? 

##A4

```{r}
qnorm(0.95, mean = 1100, sd = 75/sqrt(100))
```

##Question 5

You flip a fair coin 5 times, about what's the probability of getting 4 or 5 heads?

##A5

```{r}
pbinom(3, size = 5, prob = 0.5, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

##Question 6

The respiratory disturbance index (RDI), a measure of sleep disturbance, for a specific population has a mean of 15 (sleep events per hour) and a standard deviation of 10. They are not normally distributed. Give your best estimate of the probability that a sample mean RDI of 100 people is between 14 and 16 events per hour?

##A6

```{r}
pnorm(16, mean = 15, sd = 1) - pnorm(14, mean = 15, sd = 1)
```

##Question 7

Consider a standard uniform density. The mean for this density is .5 and the variance is 1 / 12. You sample 1,000 observations from this distribution and take the sample mean, what value would you expect it to be near?

##A7

Via the LLN it should be near .5. 

##Question 8

The number of people showing up at a bus stop is assumed to be Poisson with a mean of 5 people per hour. You watch the bus stop for 3 hours. About what's the probability of viewing 10 or fewer people?

##A8

```{r}
ppois(10, lambda = 15)
```
